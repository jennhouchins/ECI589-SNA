# ECI589-SNA
A repository for my independent analysis for the ECI 589 Social Network Analysis in Education course offered as part of the NC State College of Education's Learning Analytics Graduate Certificate Program.

# REPOSITORY STRUCTURE

This repository will house all the R project directories for each independent analysis for the ECI 589 course. As these independent analysis projects are completed, they will be listed below:

- Independent Analysis Project 1 (Project Name): Brief description of the project and its focus.


Each project will include its own README file, project specific files (e.g., R scripts, Rmd files, and/or data when sharing is possible).
