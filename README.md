# ECI589-SNA
A repository for my independent analysis for the ECI 589 Social Network Analysis in Education course offered as part of the NC State College of Education's Learning Analytics Graduate Certificate Program.

# REPOSITORY STRUCTURE

This repository will house all the R project directories for each independent analysis for the ECI 589 course. As these independent analysis projects are completed, they will be listed below:

- Unit 1 Independent Analysis: The Unit 1 Independent Analysis is the first attempt at social network analysis in R on my own. It examines the data for a MOOC-Ed course. Specifically, it looks at the sub-network consisting of the actors with the most ties to one another.
- Unit 2 Independent Analysis: The Unit 2 Independent Analysis project examines Twitter data related to #CSforAll or other CS education tweets for a network and communities of CS educators. It also looks at the CS educators overall sentiments when posting these tweets.


Each project will include its own README file, project specific files (e.g., R scripts, Rmd files, and/or data when sharing is possible).
