# Context

For my independent analysis this week, I am examining the networks that emerged 
in the second offering of the Digital Learning Transition in K-12 Schools MOOC-Ed 
(designated DLT2; offered in September 2013).
<br /><br />
The .red[**data sources**] available from the [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/ZZH3UB) are:
- **MOOC-Ed registration form.** (Our actors contained in dlt2_nodes.csv)
- **MOOC-Ed discussion forums.** (Our ties contained in dlt2_edgelist.)
<br /><br />

# Guiding Question
.font90[
The question framing this independent analysis are:
- What are the patterns of interaction and structure of peer networks that emerge in the DLT2 MOOC-Ed for actors with the most ties?
  - This uses the same methods we applied in the Guided Walkthrough which examined the first section of the MOOC-Ed (DLT1).
  - I also employed the methods described by Katherine Ognyanova's tutorial [Network Analysis and Visualization with R and igraph](https://kateto.net/netscix2016.html) 
- Specifically, in addition to examining the sub-network of actors with the most ties, I also looked out 
  - Hubs and Authorities
  - Clusters and communities

# Methods
This independent analysis uses the following packages in R.

```{r package-loading, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) #<<
library(igraph) #<<
library(here)
```


Of course, I'm using both `tidyverse` and `igraph` like the guided walkthrough. And 
as you'll see on the next slide, the `here` package helps with project pathways. 
If you haven't heard about it, you may want to check it out.

# Methods (continued)

As mentioned in the context, the ties of this network are in the `dlt2_edgelist.csv` file.

.code60[
```{r import-edges, echo=TRUE}
ties <- read_csv(here("Presentation", "data","dlt2_edgelist.csv"), 
                 col_types = cols(Sender = col_character(), 
                                  Receiver = col_character(), 
                                  Category = col_skip(), 
                                  CommentID = col_character(), 
                                  DiscussionID = col_character()))

engaged <- ties %>% #<<
  count(Sender, Receiver) %>% #<<
  filter(n >= 6) #<<

```
]

To find the actors with most ties, I'm counting the ties between sender and 
receiver pairs and filtering for those that have 6 or more ties.

---
# Methods (continued)

The actors of this network are in the `dlt2_nodes.csv` file. I'm filtering for those 
actors that appear in my `engaged` list with the most ties.

```{r import-actors, echo=TRUE}
actors <- read_csv(here("Presentation", "data", "dlt2_nodes.csv"), 
                   col_types = cols(uid = col_character(), 
                                    facilitator = col_integer(), 
                                    expert = col_character(), 
                                    connect = col_character())) %>% 
  filter(uid %in% engaged$Sender | uid %in% engaged$Receiver) #<<
```

# Creating the Network

To create the network, I simply supplied my `engaged` list of ties to the `graph_from_data_frame` function.
.code70[
```{r igraph-network, echo=TRUE}
network <- graph_from_data_frame(d = engaged, #<< 
                                 vertices = actors, 
                                 directed = T) 
network
```
]

# Simplified Network

That resulted in a directed network with .red[16 nodes] and .red[16 edges] that's already 
looking interesting. Simplifying the network to remove loops reveals that there was only 
one loop since only one edge is removed.

.code70[
```{r simple-network, echo=TRUE}
simple_network <- simplify(network, remove.loops = TRUE) 
simple_network
```
]

---
class: clear, inverse, middle

Next I calculated edge weights and created a simplified weighted network that I could explore...

```{r edge-weights}
edge_weights <- count(ties, Sender, Receiver) 
```

```{r add-weights}
E(network)$weight <- 1  
```

```{r simplify-weighted-net}
weighted_network <- simplify(network,
                             edge.attr.comb = list(weight="sum"))

```

# Exploring the Network - Node Degree

.pull-left[
```{r node-degree}
node_degree <- degree(weighted_network, mode = "all")
hist(node_degree, breaks = 30)
```
]

.pull-right[
<br />
```{r node-degree-stats, echo=TRUE}
mean(node_degree)
median(node_degree)
```
]

???
You might not be surprised that a network with 16 nodes and 16 edges has a median node degree of 1.
---
class: no-logo
# Exploring the Network - In Degree
.pull-left[
```{r}
in_degree <- degree(weighted_network, mode="in")

hist(in_degree, breaks = 30)
```
]

.pull-right[
<br />
```{r, echo=TRUE}
mean(in_degree)
median(in_degree)
```
]

??? 

The in degree is a bit different with a median of 0. You'll see why this is when we visualize this sub-network.

---
class: no-logo
# Exploring the Network - Out Degree

.pull-left[
```{r}
out_degree <- degree(weighted_network, mode="out")
hist(out_degree, breaks = 30)
```
]

.pull-right[
<br />
```{r, echo=TRUE}
mean(out_degree)
median(out_degree)
```
]

???

The out degree is looks a bit more like the node degree results. This suggests 
that most nodes in this sub-network are folks responding to a discussion post, 
but not receiving a response themselves.

The one difference is the mean. While the mean was closer to 2 for node degree, 
here it is much closer to the median. This suggests that overall there is a node 
(or nodes) with higher overall node degree. Let's check that out by visualizing 
the network.

# Visualizing The Network
.pull-left[
In this network, the vertices (or nodes) are colored by whether or not the actor is a MOOC-Ed course facilitator. 

The two .red[**red nodes**] are .red[**facilitators**] and the .blue[**blue nodes**] are .blue[**course participants**].
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
node_colors <- c("#4156a1", "#990000")
V(weighted_network)$color <- node_colors[V(weighted_network)$facilitator + 1]

plot(weighted_network,
     vertex.color = V(weighted_network)$color,
     vertex.size = 30,
     edge.arrow.size = .05,
     vertex.label = V(weighted_network)$uid,
     # vertex.label.dist = 3,
     vertex.label.color = "white",
     # edge.width = E(weighted_network)$weight,
     layout = layout_with_fr)
```

# Hubs and Authorities
.font70[According to the Ognyanova's tutorial (Section 6.8), hubs are identified with 
large numbers of outgoing links and authorities are identified with large numbers of incoming links.]

```{r}
hs <- hub_score(weighted_network, weights=NA)$vector

as <- authority_score(weighted_network, weights=NA)$vector
```
.pull-left[
```{r}
 plot(weighted_network, 
      vertex.size=hs*50,
      vertex.color = V(weighted_network)$color,
      # vertex.size = node_degree*.05,
      edge.arrow.size = .05,
      vertex.label = V(weighted_network)$uid,
      vertex.label.color = "white",
      # edge.width = E(weighted_network)$weight,
      layout = layout_nicely,
      main="Hubs")
```

]

.pull-right[
```{r}
 plot(weighted_network, 
      vertex.size=as*50,
      vertex.color = V(weighted_network)$color,
      edge.arrow.size = .05,
      vertex.label = V(weighted_network)$uid,
      vertex.label.color = "white",
      # edge.width = E(weighted_network)$weight,
      layout = layout_nicely,
      main="Authorities")
```
]
---
class: no-logo
# Clusters

It may seem obvious since this sub-network is so simple, but let's identify the communities within it anyway.

```{r, fig.align='center', warning=FALSE}
undirected_network <- as.undirected(weighted_network, mode= "collapse",
                         edge.attr.comb=list(weight="sum", "ignore"))

ceb <- cluster_edge_betweenness(undirected_network) 
V(weighted_network)$community <- ceb$membership
community_colors <- c("#d14905", "#008473")
plot(weighted_network, 
     vertex.size = 30,
     edge.arrow.size = .05,
     vertex.label = V(weighted_network)$uid,
     vertex.color = community_colors[V(weighted_network)$community],
     vertex.label.color = "white",
     layout = layout_nicely) 
```

.center[Some observations...]

----

- This analysis seems to have identified that the most activity in the network 
is from participants responding to the facilitator. Perhaps to the discussion forum prompts? 

--

- Course facilitator 302 is likely the lead course instructor since analysis revealed them as the 
"authority"

--

- Interestingly, it looks the course participants didn't engage with one another very often.
